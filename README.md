# AI_Degrees

This program determines how many degrees of separation apart any two actors are.

"According to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game, anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in.

In this problem, we're interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in X-Men: First Class, and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in Apollo 13."
